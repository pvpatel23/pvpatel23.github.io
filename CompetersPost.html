                    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This Work Term Report highlights my work experience during my 8-month co-op work term from January â€“ August 2022. This was my third work term in my co-op program.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">About Competers</h2>
                    <p>Competers was founded with the idea to bring a software solution to help manage the process of utility locating. They provide SaaS for the many steps involved in locating, providing solutions for documentation, map corrections, emailing systems, and utility sketches amongst other tools. Their products let locating services focus on their expertise while the software handles the data management.</p>
                    <p>The company was originally created in the late 1980s but it was recently bought by two brothers, Shane and Greg Hart, in the past decade. They have since revamped the business model and have been expanding the business rapidly. Ontario in the past year had approximately 6 million locating requests and Competers handled about 40% of them. Competers is not a large corporation but rather a small team of around 10 individuals providing software solutions across Canada and even the United States.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">My Job</h2>
                    <p>Through the course of these two co-op terms, I had a chance to work on both my technical skills as well as my soft skills. My position was that of a full stack developer and I had a chance to work on the many ongoing projects at Competers. At the start of my work term, I also had the chance to work an email parser we were developing to automatically handle requests sent from Ontario One Call. The parser was in JavaScript and gave me an opportunity to revisit the language. A considerable amount of my time was spent working with the database, either directly or indirectly. Prior to this work term, I had very limited knowledge of database practices, only having one course I had taken to lean on. I developed a stronger understanding of database structures and how to manipulate them for static data as well as extracting other statistics and inquiries. The queries I wrote were in MySQL.</p>
                    <p>I also worked on the Utilocate program, one of the core software services Competers provides. It is Windows application and as such I worked in VB.NET to do various development tasks. I debugged many of the issues that were identified. As a full-stack developer this encompassed both functional aspects of the program which were not working correctly as well as issues with the interface. This was my favourite environment to work in as it often corresponded with multiple aspects of our other projects. I would create functions that queried the database for necessary pieces of information and relay that to the user interface.</p>
                    <p>One of the other areas working in this application let me explore was the Amazon Web Services we were using. Our entire operation is in the cloud; from hosting our database, to our code assets and our auto-emailing system which kept track of requests coming in to our clients. I was thrilled to work with the AWS products we were using. I had prior experience with creating a project with AWS products and this gave me the chance to further solidify what I had learned. I primarily worked with the AWS Lambda Functions, S3 Buckets, Cloud9, and CloudWatch but I was also able to explore the uses of some newer technologies like their Textract image processor.</p>
                    <p>I also had the opportunity to work with clients. My responsibilities entailed helping clients with software issues and diagnosing the source of the problem. I also took requests any clients had and relayed this information back to our sprint planning. Most of the time, the users had questions regarding our software and how to operate it and deal with certain procedures.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">My Winter Goals</h2>
                    <p>At the start of my winter co-op work term at Competers, my goals were a mix of learning the associated technologies I would be working with and project management. Until now in my career, I have learned about myself that I can pick up new technologies effectively, however, how quickly I can apply these technical skills to projects was still a concern for me. After evaluating my goals and making a few adjustments with my manager, I decided I wanted to focus on project management in order to better grasp how I can apply skills I learned.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I want to become better at familiarizing myself with a new project. This is goal I am continuing to work on from the previous work term. I find that when I approach a new project, the stretch it takes me to before I make significant contribution consumes a large portion of my time. I want to adapt my current strategy to allow me to get a quicker grasp on the entirety of the project. This is important because time can be a very expensive resource in these projects. I believe, the ability to pick up and become comfortable in a new environment is a skill that would be of great use to me, even outside of code development practices.</li>    
                        <li>I want to work on my task management and awareness skills.  A project is based around the code you write however, it is not the only aspect. Planning, designing, understanding requirements and other details make up vital components of the project. I want to better my understanding of project management so I can see a more coherent image of what the project goal and destination is. However, before I reach this stage, I need to be more aware of the smaller tasks that a project is composed of.</li>    
                        <li>I want to improve my ability to write SQL queries to diagnose the source of issues within the system. A large portion of our software is the database and how it is managed. Developing the skills to query the correct information will not only help me understand the software as a whole but it will also let me narrow down the possible points of failure that problem rooted from.</li>    
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="subheading">My Summer Goals</h2>
                    <p>My goals for my second co-op work term at Competers were similar to my winter goals, but with a few changes. I directed my focus to learn new technical skills as my tasks were now involved in different parts of the projects which required new skills. I hashed out my previous goal of project management with my manager as I realized what I actually wanted to focus on was slightly different. I wanted to improve the time it took before I started contributing to a new project and this required better understanding of project awareness and how everything fits in to the big picture.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I want to learn to use backend technologies such as JavaScript, .NET, AWS, and MySQL among others. Developing these skills will overall increase my understanding and proficiency in these technologies. Many of these technologies are related to cloud development and I believe that is worthwhile field to mature my skills in.</li>    
                        <li>I want to become better at familiarizing myself with a new project. It is important to understand the project with breadth and depth to effectively contribute to it. I find that when I approach a new project, the stretch it takes me to before I make significant contribution consumes a large portion of my time. I want to build a strategy that enables me to get a quicker grasp on the entirety of the project. This is important because time can be a very expensive resource in these projects, and my team and I would both benefit as I would be able to utilize my skillset to make progress on the project. I also believe, the ability to pick up and become comfortable in a new environment is a skill that would be of great use to me, even outside of code development practices.</li>   
                        <li>I want to work on my project management and awareness skills. A project is based around the code you write however, it is not the only aspect. Planning, designing, understanding requirement and other details make up vital components of the project. I want to better my understanding of project management so I can see a more coherent image of what the project goal and destination is. This will help me in multiple regards. Project management gives direction to the efforts put in a project to maximize efficiency, which is a crucial reason why I want to be more aware of it. It also lets me participate in the project more effectively as a team member, as I will be conscious of what others are working on.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="subheading">What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>After completing these two work terms, there is quite a bit I feel I have learned. Right off the bat, my pool of technical skills has vastly expanded. I worked quite a bit with the MySQL database and I have considerably improved my ability to write queries for them. This was a skill I learned mostly on the job. Prior to this work, I only had rudimentary knowledge on general database practices. I also feel I am able to use VB.NET effectively to program various features and functions and use the framework in accordance with other technologies such as MySQL and AWS.</p>
                    <p>My approach to learning these skills was mixture of reading online resources as well as simply practicing what I know to get a result in my work. I found this generally worked best for me. Reading up and doing research is important but there is a threshold and beyond it, practical application is far more productive.</p>
                    <p>However, before I really got into development sprints, I started off on debugging programs. As a full stack developer, I got a taste of mostly everything. I worked on features that were user interactive, as well on those that were strictly functional and did work behind the scenes. Debugging the code in this manner helped me in my later tasks in which I was developing requested features or expanding on pre-existing ones. It helped me get a better idea of the code conventions used and general practices to adhere to. One of my goals during the work term was to improve my ability to quickly pick up a new project and this was one avenue through which I was able to do so.</p>
                    <p>Debugging led to development and in the process, I learned something I kind of already new but now it is ingrained in me. What I found of great value was documentation. In a program of this large scale, it is crippling if proper documentation is not made. It not only helps you track your progress, but it supports others when they are dependent on something you have worked on. Documentation is needed at ideally every stage in a sprint cycle. Nonetheless, in the real world, although ideal it is not always practical to document every piece of information. Sometimes it is better to work ahead, and this can be due to multiple factors such as scope, time, and essentially doing a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
                    <p>This brings me to my next learning point, doing cost-benefit analyses. There was a task I was working on, and I was mostly done but there was one issue in the implementation. The solution to which was rather complicated. My boss explained to me how itâ€™s okay to pass the feature along to be reviewed for deployment. The reason being, a product that is 90% complete is still helping customers quite a bit! In this sense, is the last 10% something that requires immediate attention? This was a lesson I greatly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>Beyond technical skills, I also had a chance to work on my soft skills. I worked with clients on almost a daily basis in latter 4 months. Talking with strangers was uncomfortable for me and it was not something I was particularly excited to do. This ended up being one of my most valued lessons this co-op term. Learning to talk with others and helping them diagnose a problem required more effort than I had thought. Different people have different mindsets, and as such they approach issues in an array of methods. Being able to find a route that works for everyone is a great skill.</p>
                    <p>One skill I did not think I would be working on was communication. I thought myself to be fairly clear at communicating. I did not realize how much I could improve. It was good that I had a secure foundation in communication but there was more I could do. Continuously updating my progress and making sure I am aware of where others have progressed was vital. In a mostly virtual work environment, it is easy to forget what others are doing. The snappy feedback you get in an office does not exist online which is why you need to be proactive to make sure progress is halted. I also found that I should be asking questions more often rather than tackling a problem on my own. As good as it does for me to try a problem on my own, to keep the cogs in the machine turning it is important to recognize when an extra hand is needed.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">Acknowledgements</h2>
                    <p>I am grateful to have worked with such a great team the past eight months. I would like to thank my manager, Shuaib Solker, for always providing assistance and guiding me through the projects we collaborated on. I also want to thank my supervisors, Greg Hart and Shane Hart for pushing me to go out of my comfort zone and providing constructive criticism as well as the means to work on that criticism. Lastly I would like to thank Adam Sheeres, with whom I spent the last eight months as a co-op, for providing me with support throughout this work term. Thank-you all for making this a memorable and valuable experience!</p>
