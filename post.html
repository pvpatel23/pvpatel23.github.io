                    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This Work Term Report highlights my work experience during my fall co-op work term from September – December 2020. This was my first work term in my co-op program.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">About Communitech</h2>
                    <p>Communitech was founded by entrepreneurs who wanted to help each other, and new entrepreneurs prosper and become successful. This goal is still driven after today. Communitech helps people in businesses related to the tech field. From sales and data analysis to marketing and networking, Communitech provides support to tech companies across Canada.

                    </p>
                    <h2 class="subheading">My Job</h2>
                    <p>During this co-op term, I learned many skills, both technical and soft. I developed a deeper understand of web development, especially with using HTML and CSS to design the structure of a website. I had to work with Shopify as well, leading me to learn Liquid, Shopify’s templating language. I integrated analytics tools on the websites and analyzed the data they can produce to understand how users interact with the website. Being the sole web designer on the team allowed me to work with all aspects of the website’s development. This gave me a clearer understanding of how website structures are built, the smaller individual components that make the whole website and how they function. Outside of the technical skills, I also learned how to work with a team which is not directly involved in the same work as me. My team consisted of a digital marketer, copywriter, graphic designer, and UX designer. My teammates had responsibilities that differed from my own. This gave me a different perspective and let me see the different angles to consider for a project. It helped strengthen my project awareness and communication skills as I had to keep in mind what the rest of my team was doing. </p>
                    <p>This work term, I worked with two clients. The first was Krystian’s Menswear. This client was in the middle of transitioning to a Shopify store and so they only had the very basic parts of their Shopify store set up. This project entailed designing a brand new look for the website. I started with learning the client’s goals for the website during our first consultation. I then worked with my UX designer to decide the website flow. After we had a plan for the look of the website, I started the development of the website. I designed almost every page of the website, including anything from the landing page to their policies’ page.</p>
                    <p>The second client I worked with was Goldcoast Fashions. This client had a Shopify store set up but during the first consultation it was discussed that they wanted a redesign for their store. I got to do the regular page building for this website as well as modifying the Liquid templates used to structure the Shopify store. This was to implement unique features such as a Terms and Conditions prompt for the user before they proceed to the checkout. I also set up analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel.</p>
                    <p>In general, I worked with clients who needed a new design for their Shopify stores. I was responsible for building attractive but fast landing pages to improve SEO and user retention on the website.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">My Goals</h2>
                    <p>At the start of my co-op work term, my goal was to learn the concerned technologies of web development. I worked on a few goals related to the technical skills I wanted to learn but I realized, working with a team requires more than just technical skills. I was fortunate to be on a team with members who had developed an expertise in their own field. Discussing this with my supervisor, I decided another goal of mine would be to understand the different aspects of the project.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I want to learn to use HTML and CSS to help me design websites more effectively. This will help me with design choices I make to improve user experience.</li>
                        <li>I want to learn Liquid (Shopify’s templating language) to enhance my work when working with Shopify websites.</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to use Shopify’s framework to create a coherent website that integrates both HTML and Liquid, as well as third party web analytics tools. This will help me gain exposure to a new framework and the steps I take to learn it.</li>
                        <li>I want to learn to be more aware of the project as a whole and what it requires to be successfully completed. This awareness will help me understand the different aspects the rest of my team is working on. Knowing this, I can help them with parts of their work and make my work better fit the project’s goals.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="subheading">What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>After completing this work term, I feel I have improved on my HTML and CSS for web design. I can structure a website and its components effectively to match what the client wants. I did struggle a bit more when I worked with my first client but by the end of my interaction with them, I was confident with the website I had built. This transferred to when I worked with my second client as well. The only difference was that from the beginning I had a better picture of the flow of the project and the angles I needed to consider.</p>
                    <p>Liquid was a completely new language I had no experience with. I found that following tutorials was a great place to start. However, reading and watching videos was only getting me so far. With my first client, I had very minimal work that involved Liquid. It was with my second client that I was able to play around with the language more. Manipulating the website template helped me figure out what the language does and how it works. I feel I made good progress on this goal, but I wish I could have done more with the language. The clients I worked with did not often want unique features in their website which is part of the reason why I was limited in interacting with language more. This is why I think there is still more left for me to do with respect to this goal.</p>
                    <p>By the end of my work term, I was able to implement HTML aspects coherently with Shopify’s framework. I created HTML code for specific features the client requested as well as using Liquid to ensure it functioned correctly. I also set up analytics tools (namely Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel) to help the client collect data on how user interact with their website. With my team, I explained to the client how they could use this data to help them adapt to the user’s preference.</p>
                    <p>All my goals were technical skills I wanted to achieve. However, after discussing with both my co-op coordinator and my work supervisor, I came up with a goal that would teach me skills beyond the technical aspects of my job. I was also in a unique position where my teammates work did not have the same area as focus as my work did. Our team was not a specialized team. Instead our project scope covered almost every aspect of the business. Anything from marketing to website maintenance our team was responsible for. This taught me there is much more to a project other than the part I am working on. I think this is something I can use in the future as well when my teams only consist of members working on the same thing as me. It will help me pay attention to the other aspects of the project that people outside my team are working on.</p>
                    <p>Arguably, one of the most important things I learned was my process of learning. I found an effective way for me to approach a problem is to first study and research it to get an idea of what the problems requires me to do. However, I should not stay stuck at this point for very long as I start making the most progress when I start working on the problem itself to find obstacles. Preparation helps me but it should not hold me back from ever starting the work. The sooner I find my obstacles, the sooner I can overcome them.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="subheading">Acknowledgements</h2>
                    <p>	I was fortunate to work and interact with many people over the last four months. I want to thank my team lead, Salman Arain, for helping guide me through the projects we worked. I would also like to say thank-you to my co-op supervisor, Mustafa Nabelsi, for providing me with the support I needed to make sure, as a student, I was successful. Lastly, I would like to mention my team, Bernadette Fila, Brittney Cheng, Leah Ross, and Mike Rugo. Thank-you for the collaborative experience you provided and making this work term enjoyable!</p>

                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those
                        which divide us.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
                            touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg"></a><span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
